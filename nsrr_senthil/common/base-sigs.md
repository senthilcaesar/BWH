# Base EDF signal definitions

This table reflects the definitions in
```
nsrr/common/resources/base.canonical.sigs
```
which is the underlying file used by NAP to create the _base EDF_ from a
_harmonized EDF_ (and should be kept in sync with the former).

These are the only channels that may be present only in the _base EDF_
generated by NAP; if they are present, they will have the sample rates and units
as specified below.

The second column indicates which channels (in the _harmonized EDF_)
are used to generate these channels: where more than one is listed,
the first (left to right) that exists will be used to generate the
canonical signal (i.e.  they are taken to be interchangeable from the
perspective of subsequently using that canonical signal).

Note that these canonical channels intentionally have a distinctive naming scheme (i.e. `csC4`
rather than the corresponding harmonized term `C4-M1`).  This 
underscores the fact that these signals may be
transformations of the original signals (i.e. resampling and rescaling
and/or re-referencing).  That is, `csC4` in the base EDF is not
necessarily (numerically) the identical signal as `C4-M1` in the
corresponding harmonized EDF, and we use this naming convention to always make
that clear.
