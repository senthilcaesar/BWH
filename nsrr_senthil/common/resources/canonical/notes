Flow Notes-

removed N_Pres and N.Press they were in the Stages cohort and were not legitimate signals, they were originally filed under flow/under unspecified airflow.  I looked at 3 EDFs and the signals were flat or artifactual the entire recording.

removed NPV, NPV_flow, PN, NAP, PNEUMFlow, PTAF from Nasal pressure

these channels were small in numbers, the channel names are very specific and generally not what you would think of for nasal pressure

looked into NasalSn,NasOr,NasOr2 these are from the Stages cohort.  Very little documentation was received, keeping these in the unspecified airflow category

for the MaskFlow signal in Homepap there are studies that have a V unit and they are legitimate signals, and there are MaskFlow signals that also have a l/min legitimate signal
