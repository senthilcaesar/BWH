This is the version of AnalyzeData used for this analysis.

The 'Flow index' (col A) is used mostly throughout processing to refer to individual pts.
The FlowIndx goes up to 54, but only 41 pts were ever included in analysis, as shown in 'Flow&Edi' (col M).

We ended up removing Pt 1264 from this analysis because of pcrit interference on flow signal.
Pt1264 is FlowIndx 11, and the ninth in Flow&Edi.
