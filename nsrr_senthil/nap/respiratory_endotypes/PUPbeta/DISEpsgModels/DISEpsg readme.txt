DISEpsg is a collaborative project led by Sara Op de Beeck, PhD, Antwerp.

The goal of the project is to describe differences in the flow shape characteristics (seen in a routine sleep study) between patients with different sites of upper airway obstruction. Results of the work may lead to a means to identify the likelihood of a patient exhibiting a particular site of collapse. 

Results from this project work are not yet available for widespread use (Feb 22, 2022). The work is under development. Users of PUP are asked to wait until this work is completed before use in their own studies. For exceptions, please contact Sara Op de Beeck.
