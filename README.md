# ShinyProxy
ShinyProxy is your favourite way to deploy Shiny apps in an enterprise context.
When deploying a Shiny application with ShinyProxy, the application is simply bundled 
as an R package and installed into a Docker image. Every time a user runs an application, 
a container spins up and serves the application.
